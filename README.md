# Module 3 Challenge


## Description

This project was created to be a password generator where a user can change the size and contents of their random password. 
This allows me to practice JS code and to generate a brand new random password.
I learned more about JavaScript and got some good practice. 


## Installation

N/A


## Usage

A user can click on the "Generate Password" button and then answer a series of prompts to change the contents of their password. Once all are answered,  a random password will generate in the box
